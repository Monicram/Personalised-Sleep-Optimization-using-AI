# Personalized Sleep Optimization using AI

## 📌 Project Overview
Personalized Sleep Optimization using AI is an intelligent system designed to analyze eye images and lifestyle data to detect sleep health conditions and provide personalized sleep recommendations. The system combines computer vision, machine learning, and an AI-based chatbot to help users improve their sleep quality.

## 🚀 Features
- AI-based sleep health detection
- Eye image analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Lifestyle data–based sleep prediction
- Personalized sleep recommendations
- Interactive AI chatbot
- User-friendly web interface

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning (CNN)
- HTML
- AI Chatbot
- Dataset-driven prediction
